## General instructions on how to contribute?

**Step 1:** Fork your own copy of Problem Solving into your GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button present at the right top corner of the [repository](https://github.com/galaumang/ds-algo) page.

**Step 2:** Navigate to your account and clone that copy to your development box

`git clone https://github.com/<username>/ds-algo`

**Step 3:** Create a branch and start working on your problem and include unit tests with different test cases.

**Step 4:** Once you have done all the changes make a local commit and push to your repository.

**Step 5:** Now you need to create a Pull Request(PR). You can do this from the GitHub UI. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request).

**Step 6:** Once you have successfully created a PR, someone from the Problem Solving team will review and approve or request changes if any. If any changes are requested then you need to make those changes in your already checked out copy(same branch), make a local commit, and push them to your repository.

**Step 7:** Soon after pushing the changes to your repository, the PR will get updated. You can now go and comment on the PR asking for a review.

**Step 8:** Once all the changes are approved, someone from the Problem-Solving team will push the change to the upstream code. That's it! 

Congratulations!!
